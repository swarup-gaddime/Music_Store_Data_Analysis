# Music_Store_Data_Analysis

Data Exploration & Insights using SQL

This project analyzes a Music Store database using SQL to uncover business insights related to customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and sales performance.
It demonstrates practical SQL skills including joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

The Music Store data contains customer details, invoices, tracks, genres, albums, artists, and employee information.
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answer real business questions such as:

1) Who is the senior most employee based on job title?

2) Which countries have the most invoices?

3) What are top 3 values of total invoice?

4) Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. 
   Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoices totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals

5) Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money

6) Write a query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return you list ordered alphabetically by email starting with alter

7) Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands

8) Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first


This project is ideal for practice in SQL, data analysis, and relational database concepts.
